#FileSystem-Git

*Note: This repository contains work-in-progress code. Do not expect it to work.*

FileSystem-Git is a [Git](http://www.git-scm.com) implementation for [Pharo](http://www.pharo-project.org) Smalltalk. The focus of this project is to bring the power of version management that Git provides to the Pharo environment without forcing users to use a command line (at least for day-to-day workflows).

This repository is part proof of concept and part backup for the development of FileSystem-Git and [FileTree](https://github.com/dalehenrich/filetree).
